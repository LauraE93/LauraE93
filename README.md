- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LauraE93
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in furthering my learning within coding and programming to hopefully go into a career change.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning via "freecodecamp.org" and am half way through my "Responsive Web Design Certification". I am then looking to go onto Javascript and after that a course on Frontend Development.
